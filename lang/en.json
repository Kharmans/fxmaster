  "FXMASTER.TourOverviewEffectControlsTitle": "Effect Controls",
  "FXMASTER.TourOverviewEffectControlsContent": "The Effect Controls allow Gamemaster users and Player users with appropriate permissions to configure various types of effects.\nThere are <em>Special Effects</em>, <em>Particle Effects</em>, and <em>Filter Effects</em>.\nWe will now go through the different tools that are available, and briefly explain them.",
  "FXMASTER.TourOverviewSpecialEffectsTitle": "Special Effects",
  "FXMASTER.TourOverviewSpecialEffectsContent": "Special Effects are just video files that can be played on the canvas by clicking or dragging. It is also possible to create Tiles from these effects, in order to have permanently playing variants.\nFXMaster includes only a couple of example Special Effects. If you want more, you will need to install a module providing animation files, for example <a href='https://foundryvtt.com/packages/JB2A_DnD5e/' target='_blank'>JB2A</a>, <a href='https://foundryvtt.com/packages/jaamod' target='_blank'>Jinker’s Animated Art Pack</a>, or <a href='https://foundryvtt.com/packages/animated-spell-effects' target='_blank'>Jack Kerouac’s Animated Spell Effects</a>.

  "FXMASTER.TourOverviewParticleEffectsTitle": "Particle Effects",
  "FXMASTER.TourOverviewParticleEffectsContent": "Particle Effects are global effects that are displayed all accross the scene. They include weather effects like rain, fog, clouds, and snow, but also other particle based effects, such as certain animals moving accross the scene, or floating bubbles.\nIt is also possible to limit the area in which these effects are displayed by using drawings to create a mask.",
  "FXMASTER.TourOverviewInvertMaskTitle": "Invert Particle Effect Mask",

  "FXMASTER.TourOverviewFilterEffectsTitle": "Filter Effects",
  "FXMASTER.TourOverviewFilterEffectsContent": "Filter Effects work similarly to Particle Effects. They are also displayed across the entire scene, but instead of displaying particles, they adjust the scene in specific ways, such as changing its color, or distorting it to create an underwater-like effect.\nIt is not possible to mask Filter Effects.",
  "FXMASTER.TourOverviewSaveTitle": "Save as Macro",
  "FXMASTER.TourOverviewSaveContent": "This creates a Macro from the current Particle and Filter Effects of the viewed Scene. When activated, it sets the Particle and Filter Effects of the viewed scene accordinlgy.\nThe macro is just put into the Macro Directory and not added to the Hotbar automatically.",
  "FXMASTER.TourOverviewClearTitle": "Clear",
  "FXMASTER.TourOverviewClearContent": "This clears all Particle and Filter Effects of the Scene.\nIt does not remove any permanently playing Special Effects. Since those are just Tiles, they need to be removed via the Tile Controls.",

  "FXMASTER.TourOverviewHelpContent": "Using FXMaster can seem a bit daunting at first, but we hope this and the other provided tours will help you with getting started.\nIn case you still have any open questions afterwards, all functionality is documented in the <a href='https://github.com/ghost-fvtt/fxmaster/blob/main/README.md' target='_blank'>Readme</a>, including the FXMaster API, which you can use to create your own custom Macros.
